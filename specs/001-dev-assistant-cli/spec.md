# Feature Specification: Developer Assistant CLI

**Feature Branch**: `001-dev-assistant-cli`
**Created**: 2026-01-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Agentic Assistant for Developers - Python CLI application with multi-context aggregation, Unified Morning Brief, meeting scheduling, dynamic personal assistant with learning preferences, stakeholder inquiry, pair programming/mentoring, quarterly connection notes, EC2 sandbox toggle, and auto-response capabilities with human-in-the-loop.

## Overview

A Python CLI application that serves as an intelligent developer assistant, aggregating context from multiple sources (Gmail, Slack, JIRA, GitHub/GitLab, AI Workspace, Org Charts/LDAP) to provide actionable insights and automate routine tasks. The CLI-first architecture enables future UI extensions (Slack bot, web app, etc.) through a shared service layer.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Unified Morning Brief (Priority: P1)

As a developer starting my workday, I want to receive a consolidated summary of all relevant updates across my communication and work tracking tools so I can quickly understand what needs my attention today.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - aggregating context from multiple sources into a single actionable summary. It demonstrates the multi-source integration and AI summarization capabilities.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running a single CLI command that fetches and summarizes data from configured sources, delivering immediate value as a standalone feature.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has configured at least one context source (e.g., Gmail), **When** they run the morning brief command, **Then** they receive a formatted summary of relevant items from that source within 30 seconds.

2. **Given** the user has configured multiple context sources, **When** they run the morning brief command, **Then** all sources are queried and results are merged into a prioritized, coherent summary.

3. **Given** a context source is temporarily unavailable, **When** the morning brief runs, **Then** the system gracefully degrades by showing available data and noting which sources failed.

4. **Given** the user has previously indicated preferences (e.g., "prioritize security alerts"), **When** generating the brief, **Then** matching items appear at the top of the summary.

### User Story 2 - Context Source Configuration (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want to configure which context sources to connect (Gmail, Slack, JIRA, GitHub, etc.) so the assistant can access my relevant data.

**Why this priority**: Required foundation for all other features - without context source configuration, no aggregation is possible.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running configuration commands and verifying credentials are stored securely and connections can be validated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh installation, **When** the user runs the configure command for a source, **Then** they are guided through OAuth or API key setup with clear instructions.

2. **Given** valid credentials are provided, **When** configuration completes, **Then** a connection test is performed and success/failure is clearly reported.

3. **Given** credentials are stored, **When** the user lists configured sources, **Then** they see which sources are active without exposing sensitive credential data.

4. **Given** a user wants to remove a source, **When** they run the remove command, **Then** stored credentials are securely deleted and the source is removed from aggregation.

---

### User Story 3 - Stakeholder/SME Inquiry (Priority: P2)

As a developer needing expertise, I want to ask questions and have the assistant identify relevant stakeholders or subject matter experts from organizational data so I can get help efficiently.

**Why this priority**: Leverages the context aggregation to provide immediate value for common developer need - finding the right person to ask.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by querying for expertise and verifying the system returns relevant people based on configured org data sources.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** LDAP/org chart data is configured, **When** the user asks "who knows about payment processing?", **Then** the system returns a ranked list of people with relevant expertise or project involvement.

2. **Given** the query matches multiple potential experts, **When** results are displayed, **Then** each person includes context (role, team, recent relevant activity) to help the user choose.

3. **Given** no organizational data is configured, **When** the user runs an inquiry, **Then** they receive a helpful message explaining which sources to configure.

---

### User Story 4 - Preference Learning (Priority: P2)

As a developer using the assistant regularly, I want it to learn my preferences over time so recommendations become more relevant without manual configuration.

**Why this priority**: Differentiates from static tools by providing personalized, improving experience - but requires baseline functionality first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by providing explicit feedback on results and verifying subsequent queries reflect learned preferences.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user marks an item as "important" or "not relevant", **When** similar items appear in future briefs, **Then** they are ranked higher or lower accordingly.

2. **Given** accumulated preference data exists, **When** the user views their preference profile, **Then** they can see and modify learned preferences.

3. **Given** the user wants to reset preferences, **When** they run the reset command, **Then** all learned preferences are cleared and the system returns to defaults.

---

### User Story 5 - EC2 Sandbox Toggle (Priority: P3)

As a developer with cloud development environments, I want to start/stop my EC2 sandbox instances from the CLI so I can manage costs without leaving my terminal.

**Why this priority**: Useful utility but lower priority than core context aggregation features. Simple integration that provides immediate value.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by toggling instance state and verifying the change in AWS console.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** AWS credentials are configured, **When** the user runs the sandbox status command, **Then** they see the current state of their designated sandbox instances.

2. **Given** a sandbox instance is stopped, **When** the user runs the start command, **Then** the instance starts and the user is notified when it's ready.

3. **Given** a sandbox instance is running, **When** the user runs the stop command, **Then** the instance stops and the user receives confirmation.

---

### User Story 6 - Auto-Response Draft (Priority: P3)

As a developer receiving routine inquiries, I want the assistant to draft responses to emails/Slack messages that I can review and approve before sending (human-in-the-loop).

**Why this priority**: Advanced feature requiring robust context understanding and user trust - better to nail fundamentals first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by providing a message context and verifying a sensible draft is generated for user review.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a message context is provided, **When** the user requests a draft response, **Then** a contextually appropriate draft is generated and displayed.

2. **Given** a draft is generated, **When** the user reviews it, **Then** they can approve, edit, or reject before any action is taken.

3. **Given** the user approves a draft, **When** confirmation is received, **Then** the response is sent through the appropriate channel and logged.

4. **Given** the user rejects a draft, **When** rejection is confirmed, **Then** no message is sent and the user can optionally provide feedback for improvement.

---

### User Story 7 - Quarterly Connection Notes (Priority: P3)

As a developer preparing for performance discussions, I want to generate notes summarizing my contributions and task completions for a given period so I have data for quarterly reviews.

**Why this priority**: Valuable but periodic use - core daily functionality takes precedence.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating a report for a date range and verifying it includes relevant completed work from configured sources.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** work tracking sources (JIRA, GitHub) are configured, **When** the user requests quarterly notes for a date range, **Then** a summary of completed items is generated with key metrics.

2. **Given** the generated notes are displayed, **When** the user reviews them, **Then** they can export to common formats (markdown, text).

### Edge Cases

- What happens when OAuth tokens expire mid-session? System should detect expiration, notify user, and guide re-authentication without losing work context.
- How does the system handle rate limiting from external APIs? Implement exponential backoff and inform user of delays.
- What happens when the AI model service is unavailable? Fall back to raw data presentation with clear messaging about reduced functionality.
- How does the system handle conflicting information from multiple sources? Present both with source attribution, let user determine ground truth.
- What happens when the local workspace directory is inaccessible? Fail gracefully with clear error message about storage requirements.
